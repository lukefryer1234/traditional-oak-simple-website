### Architecture Overview

The Oak Structures website follows a client-side architecture with Firebase integration:

1. **Next.js Application**: Serves as the primary frontend framework, handling routing and page rendering.
2. **Firebase Services**: Provides backend functionality including:
   - **Authentication**: User management and login
   - **Firestore**: NoSQL database for storing product, order, and user information
   - **Storage**: File storage for product images and documents
3. **Server Components/Actions**: Next.js server components and server actions for server-side logic

### Current Implementation Approach

The current implementation has several architectural issues:

1. **Firebase Integration**:
   - Direct Firebase access in server components/actions creating server/client boundary issues
   - Manual data fetching without proper caching or error handling
   - No consistent service layer for Firebase operations

2. **State Management**:
   - Relies on local component state (`useState`/`useEffect`) for data fetching
   - No global state management solution for shared data
   - No proper caching strategy for Firebase data

3. **Development Environment**:
   - Heavy reliance on Firebase emulators for all development
   - Turbopack usage causing instability issues
   - Limited separation between development and production environments

## 2. Development Plan

The development plan focuses on improving the stability, reliability, and maintainability of the Oak Structures website. The plan is divided into the following major areas:

### 1. Data Fetching and State Management

- **Implement React Query**: Add React Query for Firebase data fetching to provide proper caching, loading states, and error handling
- **Create Custom Hooks**: Develop reusable Firebase hooks to encapsulate data fetching logic
- **Optimistic Updates**: Implement optimistic updates for form submissions to improve perceived performance

### 2. Firebase and Next.js Integration

- **Client/Server Boundary Fixes**: Properly separate client and server code to avoid SSR issues
- **API Routes**: Replace direct Firebase calls in server actions with proper API routes
- **Remove Turbopack**: Use standard Next.js development server until Turbopack is more stable

### 3. Service Layer Implementation

- **Firebase Service Modules**: Create dedicated service modules for Firebase operations
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling across all Firebase interactions
- **Retry Logic**: Add retry mechanisms for intermittent connection issues with emulators

### 4. Development Environment Improvements

- **TypeScript Validation**: Enforce stricter TypeScript checking
- **Testing Setup**: Implement testing for critical paths, especially admin functions
- **Development Workflow**: Create a more reliable local development workflow

### 5. Admin Dashboard Reliability

- **Data Model Optimization**: Improve Firestore data models for better performance
- **UI State Handling**: Add proper loading and error states to all admin components
- **Transaction-Based Updates**: Use Firestore transactions for related updates

## 3. Current Development Status

2. Product configuration experiences stability issues
3. Data fetching has performance and caching problems
4. Development environment with Turbopack is unstable

## 4. Guidelines for Future Development

### Code Organization

All new code should follow these organizational principles:

1. **Component Structure**:
   - UI components in `src/components/` 
   - Page components in `src/app/`
   - Hooks in `src/hooks/`
   - Firebase services in `src/services/`
   - Utility functions in `src/utils/`

2. **State Management**:
   - Use React Query for server state
   - Use React context for global UI state
   - Keep component state local where appropriate

3. **Type Safety**:
   - Maintain strict TypeScript typing for all components and functions
   - Use Zod for runtime validation of data

### Firebase Best Practices

1. **Data Access**:
   - Never access Firebase directly from components; use hooks and services
   - Follow the repository pattern for data access
   - Implement proper error handling for all Firebase operations

2. **Security**:
   - Keep sensitive information out of client-side code
   - Follow the principle of least privilege in Firestore rules
   - Use Firebase Authentication for all user-specific operations

3. **Performance**:
   - Use query limits and pagination for large data sets
   - Implement proper indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Use caching strategies to minimize unnecessary reads

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**:
   - Start Firebase emulators with `npm run emulators:data`
   - Run the Next.js development server with `npm run dev` (without Turbopack)
   - Use the emulator UI at http://localhost:4000 for inspecting data

2. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for critical functionality
   - Test across different user roles (admin, customer)
   - Ensure error cases are properly handled

## 5. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Firebase Emulator Issues

1. **Emulators Won't Start**:
   - Check if ports are already in use
   - Ensure Firebase CLI is properly installed
   - Try running `firebase emulators:start` directly for detailed error messages

2. **Authentication Problems**:
   - For local development, use test accounts
   - Emulator Auth doesn't require real email verification
   - Create test users through the Emulator UI

3. **Firestore Connection Issues**:
   - Check console logs for connection errors
   - Ensure code is using the development environment detection
   - Verify Firestore rules allow the operations

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - Export data before shutting down: `firebase emulators:export emulator-data`
   - Import when starting: `firebase emulators:start --import=emulator-data`

### Next.js and React Issues

1. **Server Component/Client Component Confusion**:
   - Ensure Firebase is only used in client components
   - Use API routes for server-side Firebase operations
   - Check for "use client" directive in components that use client-side APIs

2. **Hydration Errors**:
   - Check for mismatches between server and client rendering
   - Ensure state is initialized properly
   - Use dynamic imports for client-only components

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - Implement proper data fetching with React Query
   - Use memoization for expensive calculations
   - Lazy load non-critical components

## 7. Firebase Configuration

The project uses Firebase for backend functionality. The Firebase configuration is stored in `src/lib/firebase.ts` and connects to the following services:

- **Firebase Project**: `timberline-commerce`
- **Authentication**: Email/password and Google sign-in
- **Firestore**: Document database for products, orders, and users
- **Storage**: File storage for product images and documentation

In development mode, the application connects to local Firebase emulators:
- Auth emulator: http://localhost:9099
- Firestore emulator: http://localhost:8080
- Storage emulator: http://localhost:9199
- Emulator UI: http://localhost:4000

## 8. Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20+)
- npm (v9+)
- Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example`
4. Add Firebase configuration to `.env.local`

### Development Workflow

#### Option 1: Complete Development Environment (Recommended)

Use the provided script to start both Firebase emulators and the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev:emulators
```

This command:
1. Starts Firebase emulators with pre-loaded data (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
2. Launches the Next.js development server on port 9002
3. Makes the Emulator UI available at http://localhost:4000

#### Option 2: Development with External Firebase Project

If you want to develop against the production Firebase project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts only the Next.js development server, connecting to the Firebase project specified in your environment variables.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `.next` directory.

### Deploying to Firebase

```bash
firebase deploy
```

This deploys the application to Firebase Hosting.
